//Original file

This is for understanding merge conflicts during git pull.


1. Cloned a git repository.
2. Added a new file (testfile).
3. Did git pull -> it works fine as it pulled a new file to the local environment.
4. Added new lines to the current file (remote repository) and pulled again. It added new lines in the file (local environment)
5. Added changes in both local and remote.
